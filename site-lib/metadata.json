sight,\nFeet on the Path, is our True fight.Not to fear,\nNo lonely heart,\nThe Dhammas real,\nIt takes out the dart.Mara's hordes,\nHave no chance to keep us caught.\nSo we are to break the bonds,\nOf worldly toil.The luminous heart,\nthat virtue brings,\nGenerous and bright\nThat goodness sings.For here we tread and toil,\nWith all our might to bear.\nTis the Buddhas realm of wisdoms,\nThat is beyond all compare.So let no darkness bind us,\nLet no ignorance hold.\nFor upright Truth, will be found withinus,\nWhen we give our all.Let not fear, nor sloth, nor idleness creep in,\nThe light of the sun, is like the Buddhas sphere.To tame and point the way, that's The Teachers Mark,\nAll those beings will to Train,\nGive-up to the Magnificent One.Tis possible that we might be weak at times,\nBut if we recall the taste of\nWisdom and Peace that has been felt\nWe will know the way, and know right friends true.Best of friends is the Buddha,\nBest of friends is Dhamma True,\nBest of friends are those who well practiced,\nBest of friends is our inward proper use.Setup the light in the heart of Darkness,\nKeep it bright and clear,\nLet the Dhamma guide us,\nBeyond the snares and traps of Mara's lair.No matter the deceptions,\nNot matter if upset,\nPut down all Wrong Views promptly,\nGive up the the Higher Quest.Rightly forward one foot forward,\nRightly on breath True.\nAll conditions known as just temporary,\nThe stigmata show us the Deathless Way.So each must bridge over this inner darkness,\nEach must tread with care and light.\nThat the Way be followed,\nThat brings true practice and insight.Don't be deceived by a culture,\nDon't follow shadows of decay,\nJust be a spiritual warrior,\nfor following totally the Buddhas Way.So now to see the water,\nThat Nibbana's End is true,\nCountless Eons no more needed,\nIf we give our life in earnest use.Without resolve we can not go forward,\nWithout forgiveness we cannot no peace,\nWithout tranquillity no solitude will help us,\nWithout Wisdom, no end can we meet.So give up to the world of the practice,\nDon't believe our own views and thoughts are right,\nLike sliver and gold, doth dross come,\nSo purity shall be ones spiritual might.Cleans away all darkness,\nWash away wrong views,\nBrighten up all precepts,\nSo one is like the shinning full moon.\n<img alt=\"Full Moon.png\"

No names can then bind us,\n... No signs can sway our hold,\nPerfect in Sīla,\nPerfect in Resolve.\nNo matter the barrier,\nNo matter the lair,\nMara will not hold us,\nFor the Well-Farer’s,\nTeachings are close to bear.Aligning in that goodness,\nWaking up to inner strength,\nEnduring patiently all contact,\nThe silent heart is best.Whatever shackles bind us,\nThe Teacher taught all worldly flaws.\nOvercoming our own
