 <br>Across the stars,<br>
Down to earth,<br>
In the heart,<br>
Truth be heard.<br>This day was dark,<br>
But dawning light,<br>
Tis the Buddhas Words,<br>
That give us practice's sight,<br>
Feet on the Path, is our True fight.<br>Not to fear,<br>
No lonely heart,<br>
The Dhammas real,<br>
It takes out the dart.<br>Mara's hordes,<br>
Have no chance to keep us caught.<br>
So we are to break the bonds,<br>
Of worldly toil.<br>The luminous heart,<br>
that virtue brings,<br>
Generous and bright<br>
That goodness sings.<br>For here we tread and toil,<br>
With all our might to bear.<br>
Tis the Buddhas realm of wisdoms,<br>
That is beyond all compare.<br>So let no darkness bind us,<br>
Let no ignorance hold.<br>
For upright Truth, will be found withinus,<br>
When we give our all.<br>Let not fear, nor sloth, nor idleness creep in,<br>
The light of the sun, is like the Buddhas sphere.<br>To tame and point the way, that's The Teachers Mark,<br>
All those beings will to Train,<br>
Give-up to the Magnificent One.<br>Tis possible that we might be weak at times,<br>
But if we recall the taste of<br>
Wisdom and Peace that has been felt<br>
We will know the way, and know right friends true.<br>Best of friends is the Buddha,<br>
Best of friends is Dhamma True,<br>
Best of friends are those who well practiced,<br>
Best of friends is our inward proper use.<br>Setup the light in the heart of Darkness,<br>
Keep it bright and clear,<br>
Let the Dhamma guide us,<br>
Beyond the snares and traps of Mara's lair.<br>No matter the deceptions,<br>
Not matter if upset,<br>
Put down all Wrong Views promptly,<br>
Give up the the Higher Quest.<br>Rightly forward one foot forward,<br>
Rightly on breath True.<br>
All conditions known as just temporary,<br>
The stigmata show us the Deathless Way.<br>So each must bridge over this inner darkness,<br>
Each must tread with care and light.<br>
That the Way be followed,<br>
That brings true practice and insight.<br>Don't be deceived by a culture,<br>
Don't follow shadows of decay,<br>
Just be a spiritual warrior,<br>
for following totally the Buddhas Way.<br>So now to see the water,<br>
That Nibbana's End is true,<br>
Countless Eons no more needed,<br>
If we give our life in earnest use.<br>Without resolve we can not go forward,<br>
Without forgiveness we cannot no peace,<br>
Without tranquillity no solitude will help us,<br>
Without Wisdom, no end can we meet.<br>So give up to the world of the practice,<br>
Don't believe our own views and thoughts are right,<br>
Like sliver and gold, doth dross come,<br>
So purity shall be ones spiritual might.<br>Cleans away all darkness,<br>
Wash away wrong views,<br>
Brighten up all precepts,<br>
So one is like the shinning full moon.<br>

 <br>Beyond the darkness,<br>
Beyond the blue,<br>
The heart of Dhamma,<br>
Is so True.<br>True to kindness,<br>
True to care,<br>
Built on Lord Buddhas wisdom,<br>
The power of his compassionate welfare.<br>Tis ardour in practice,<br>
Gumption in peace,<br>
Recollecting good action,<br>
Ending mental disease.<br>... No names can then bind us,<br>
... No signs can sway our hold,<br>
Perfect in Sīla,<br>
Perfect in Resolve.<br>
No matter the barrier,<br>
No matter the lair,<br>
Mara will not hold us,<br>
For the Well-Farer’s,<br>
Teachings are close to bear.<br>Aligning in that goodness,<br>
Waking up to inner strength,<br>
Enduring patiently all contact,<br>
The silent heart is best.<br>Whatever shackles bind us,<br>
The Teacher taught all worldly flaws.<br>
Overcoming our own weakness,<br>
Recollect the Dhamma Ever-more.<br>Sati is the light force,<br>
Sīla the inner guide,<br>
Saddhā sparks that courageous endeavour,<br>
&amp; Paññā brings Mara’s demise.<br>No matter what the world says,<br>
No matter how we feel,<br>
The Teacher Taught us earnestness,<br>
That it be imbued in the fabric of our weal.<br>From this brick &amp; mortar,<br>
From this blood &amp; bones,<br>
All lust and covetousness abandoned,<br>
All anger and hatred without a home.<br>Greatness in peacefulness our station,<br>
Greatness in fortitude our zeal,<br>
From this skeleton of action,<br>
The Kinsman of the Sun;<br>
Shows us the Path that is Real.<br>Real to Right Intention,<br>
Real to the 8 fold Path,<br>
No matter the time of practice,<br>
Ardour and splendour the Buddha's disciples art.<br>Persietence and patient endevour,<br>
Building up the causes day and night,<br>
Living up to our station of existence,<br>
Disciples of the Tathāgata,<br>
Blessed in practice's light.<br>Meditation on the loathsome,<br>
Holding to each breath,<br>
Death, decay at any moment,<br>
Extinction of suffering Best.<br>So may we flow forward with the Dhamma,<br>
The ocean, Nibbana's edge.<br><img alt="Dhamma-Flower.png" src="\lib\media\dhamma-flower.png">]]></description><link>dhamma-poems\to-know-true-peace.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Dhamma Poems/To Know True Peace.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 01:31:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\dhamma-flower.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\dhamma-flower.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Map of Dhamma Notes]]></title><description><![CDATA[
